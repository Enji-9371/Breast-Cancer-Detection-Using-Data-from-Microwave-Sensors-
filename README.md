# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Data-from-Microwave-Sensors-
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer based on tumor size (20 mm or no tumor) using a dataset containing S-parameters from a microwave sensor. The workflow involves data preprocessing, neural network design, and experimentation with the PyCaret library for model comparison and optimization.
